# React Native Application
This project is a React Native application developed for a job interview process. The project was initialized using @react-native-community/cli.

# Getting Started
This project is developed using React Native. You can follow the steps below to run the project in your local environment.

## Requirements
Node.js (LTS version recommended)
npm (npm is used instead of Yarn)
React Native CLI (required for development)
Installation
After cloning the project, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install

# Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

# Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS (Not tested yet)

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```
